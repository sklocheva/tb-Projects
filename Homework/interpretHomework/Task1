Develop a simple command interpreter with the following properties:

The interpreter takes commands from the standard input. The commands that will be currently supported are the following:

    reverse
    count-words
    reverse-words
  
- The `reverse` command has the following syntax:

		reverse <string>

	It reverses the letters in the provided string. For example

		input: reverse abra cadabra
		output: arbadac arba

- The `count-words` command has the following syntax:
		
		count-words <string>
	
	It returns the number of words in the provided string. For example
		
		input: count-words abra cadabra
		output: 2
	
- The `reverse-words` command has the following syntax:
	
		reverse-words <string>

	It reverses the order of the words in the provided string. For example
		
		input: reverse-words abra cadabra
		output: cadabra abra
		
- Possible extensions:
	- `substring <str> <substr>` - checks if `substr` is substring of `str`
	- `capitalize <str>` - makes all leters in `str` capital
	- `translate-squeese <str>` - removes depetitions of consequtive chars in `str`
	- `bin2dec <bin_number>` - translates `bin_number` from binary to decimal format
	- `rad2deg <rad_angle>` - translates angle from radians to degrees
	- `q|exit|end` - quits the interpreter
	- `makedir <name>` - creates directory called `name` in the current dir
	- `cd <name>` - changes the current directory
